# NERDGE

- Our project is about an E-Learning website that is gamified to make learning fun for students. Instead of grades for submissions, students will be able to gain EXP points.

- Our website mainly focuses on engaging students with fun learning as we as students feel that engage learning can have students to be more curious and also the interest to learn more.

- We displayed similar learning points from how its taught to us in school itself, but in our website not only does it display the learning points but also animations and also cartoon and colourful display.

- This is a company that we came up as we think that student mostly are stress so to relieve stress we decided to make a website thats less stressfull to look at.

- We got inspired by our own learning experience and also learning platforms like Kahoot and Politemall.
I also feel like bright colours like salmon, has a calming and chill effect to viewers which is why its set as one of the theme colours. 

- Why we don't have a about page? We find it weird to have a about page for a learning platform and also we as students will mostly ignore the about page and go straight to the activities to be done. 

- Having a gamified website will make the whole experience for the students more enjoyable and also stress-free, pages like leaderboard and reward page will motivate users to use these website more to achieve their goal of reaching certain level and position in leaderboard.

- To us, we feel that if this was a actual learning platform, we would also enjoy this website and also have the keen to do our work on time with these exciting website.

## Design Process

This website is mainly designed for students whos eager to learn and want to achieve a goal of reaching certainlevel to receive amazing rewards.

The website achieves the purpose of having a learning experience but in a fun and engaing way for students to be more keeen to studying. The way the website is designed is just the way how the students think and mostly like a trendsetting for the students. As NERDGE itself is actually a meme where some students may know from and will be more keen to view this website as not only they have something to look at what they relate too but also learn with a fun mindset.

This is a website that may become famous amoung students as the website is the start base of our company so the more the students use the more the buisness grows and with how the website is beneficial to the stars and the reviews given after using the website, the buisness will be able to grow more and the goal of the buisness to be achieved when this platform is shared among social media and used by student worldwide.
