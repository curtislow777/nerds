# NERDGE

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.

Our project is about an E-Learning website that is gamified to make learning fun for students. Instead of grades for submissions, students will be able to gain EXP points

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

## **Design Process**

This website is designed for students

Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

User Story #1:
As a student, I want to be able to view my grades/level/exp points for my modules so I understand how I'm performing.

User Story #2:
As a student, I want to be able to create and have my own account so I can view my own profile

User Story #3:
As a student, I want to be able to view the leaderboard so i can compete with the top students and know my standing

User Story #4:
As a user I want a navigation bar so I can navigate around the website easily

User Story #5:
As a student, I want to be able to view my modules so I can access the learning materials

User Story #6:
As a user, I want the website to be engaging and interactive

Go to the login page.
Click on the sign up button
Try to submit blank form and verify tht an error message about the required fields appear
Try to submit form with invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to create an account and verify account created is shown

Sign In Form:
Go to the login page
Try to submit the empty form and verify an error message shows
Try to log in with the wrong email or password and verify an error message shows
Try to log in with a valid email and password and verify it redirects to the homepage

Commenting feature
Go to the profile page
Try to put in a comment in the message box and submit and verify if it appears
(bug with comments appearing above each other instead of descending order)

Contact form:

Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
