# Design Process

This website is mainly designed for students whos eager to learn and want to achieve a goal of reaching certainlevel to receive amazing rewards.

The website achieves the purpose of having a learning experience but in a fun and engaing way for students to be more keeen to studying. The way the website is designed is just the way how the students think and mostly like a trendsetting for the students. As NERDGE itself is actually a meme where some students may know from and will be more keen to view this website as not only they have something to look at what they relate too but also learn with a fun mindset.

This is a website that may become famous amoung students as the website is the start base of our company so the more the students use the more the buisness grows and with how the website is beneficial to the stars and the reviews given after using the website, the buisness will be able to grow more and the goal of the buisness to be achieved when this platform is shared among social media and used by student worldwide.
